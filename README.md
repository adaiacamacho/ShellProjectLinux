# Custom Shell built in Java

This is a demo/learning project for the CodeCrafters "Build your own Shell" challenge. It is not intended to be a production-ready program, but rather a excercise for understanding how Shell works.

This projects contains:
- Built-in commands: echo, cmd, type and pwd
- Command execution
- Output redirection
- Basic navigation support

ProcessBuilder is used for external commands such as cat, ls, file-creating echo, etc. 
Some of these (for example, the file-creating echo) need to be run on a Linux/Unix system in order to be executed properly.

This is an unfinnished project and should not be taken as a full production-ready Shell.

This projects was scaffolded using a CodeCrafters challenge. The original README added in the CodeCrafters challenge is preserved in 'README_CodeCrafters.md'.
